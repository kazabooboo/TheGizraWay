title: Code Review

Typically at least one Senior developer is assign to each project, along with other developers.

Rule of thumb: Each task is developed in a separate branch and a pull request is created as soon as there is something to review.

Once the task is complete the author of the code should review it's own code, make sure all tests pass and then assign the PR to one of the senior developers, which will review the code, comment on each line that requires change, and eventually merged into master.

The CTO of the company who is in charge of the overall standardisation, will sit from time to time with each developer on past PRs and make sure the companies standards are maintained.
