title: Codified Knowledge Base

Keeping an updated developer's knowledges-base is a big chalenge, the technology evolves and diverces so quickly that keeping relevent guides and examples is not a real option, to solve this problem we notified it's more practical to use the latest snipet or solution from our implementations on recent projects, but this was not enough because we had to remember where and when we solved a specific problem, relying on our memory is probably not best idea.
That's when we came up with [yo hedley](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley), the concept is to create a project generator using [Yoeman](http://yeoman.io/) that include most used solutions and best practice that actualy works in real project, this genrator is used to scalfold all our new project and is maintained on regular bases by all of our programmers, when a new solution for a common problem is adopted we pushed to Hedley.
