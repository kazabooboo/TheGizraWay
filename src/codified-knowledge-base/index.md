title: Codified Knowledge Base
---

Keeping an updated developer's knowledges-base is a big chalenge, the technology evolves and diverces so quickly that keeping relevent guides and examples is not a real option, to solve this problem we notified it's more practical to use the latest snipet or soltion from our latest implementation in real project as guide and soltutions, but this was not enough because you had to remember where and when you solved a specific problem, relying on your developer's memory is probably not best idea.
That's when we came up with [yo hedley](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley), the concept is to create a project generator that include most used code solutions and best practice that actualy work out of the box, this genrator is used to scalfold all our new project and is maintained on regular bases by all of our programmers, when a new solution for a common problem is adopted we pushed to Hedley.
