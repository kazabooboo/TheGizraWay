## Time estimation, budget, tracking, briefing and debriefing

First stage of any project is budget definition and time estimation, those two component are key factors for any successful project, before starting to write the first line of code we should already know what are the resources available for the project.
First and most important rule is: **No matter how long it takes, fully understand the project requirement and customer expectation before starting any actual work**
This rule is the **key** to a successful project.

On many project we will have a first phase to deliver partially functional mockups to help fully understand the project specification, this phase should be T&M but within a reasonable timeframe.
