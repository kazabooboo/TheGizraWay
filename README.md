# The Gizra Way
The Gizra Way is a set of best practice and standardisation for development team and project managers that aim to deliver 100% successful project.

## Time estimation, budget, tracking, briefing and debriefing

First stage of any project is budget definition and time estimation, those two component are key factors for any succefull project, before starting to write the first line of code we should already know what are the resources available for the project.
First and most important rule is: *No matter how long it takes, fully understand the project requirement and customer expectation before starting any actual work*
This rule is the *key* to a successful project.

On many project we will have a first phase to deliver partialy functional mockups to help fully understand the project specification, this phase should be T&M but within a reasonable timeframe.

### Deliverables

* Time estimate per task, the resolution should be no more than 8-10H per task.
* Allocated resources - Number of developers and other team member available for the project.
* Time table and milestones - Accoring to the first 2 deliverable above + extra time for the unexpected
