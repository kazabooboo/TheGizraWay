## The Code review
Typically at least one Senior developer is assign to each project, along with other developers, rule of thumb here is each new piece of code is developed in a separate branch and a pull request is created at least at the end of the first day.
Once the task is complete the author of the code should review it's own code, make sure all test pass and then assign the PR to one of the senior developers, which will review the code, comment on each line that requires change, and eventually merged into master.

The CTO of the company who is in charge of the overall standardisation, will sit from time to time with each developer on past PRs and make sure the companies standards are maintained.


## Testing suites
**Rules of thumbs:**
* 100% of project have automated test coverage.
* 100% of access related function are tested.
* We aim to have 10%-15% of feature covered by automated testing.
