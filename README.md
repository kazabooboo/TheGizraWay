# The Gizra Way
The Gizra Way is a set of best practice and standardisation for development team and project managers that aim to deliver 100% successful project.

## Time estimation, budget, tracking, briefing and debriefing
First stage of any project is budget definition and time estimation, those two component are key factors for any successful project, before starting to write the first line of code we should already know what are the resources available for the project.
First and most important rule is: **No matter how long it takes, fully understand the project requirement and customer expectation before starting any actual work**
This rule is the **key** to a successful project.

On many project we will have a first phase to deliver partially functional mockups to help fully understand the project specification, this phase should be T&M but within a reasonable timeframe.

### HTML Markup first

### Deliverables
* Time estimate per task, the resolution should be no more than 8-10H per task. [Template for Time estimation](https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0AkSgt1Y3Gz0odDlTajhLR3FocGJSaXp5aXNsSHZabmc&mode=public)
* Allocated resources - Number of developers and other team member available for the project.
* Time table and milestones - According to the first 2 deliverable above + extra time for the unexpected 

### Briefing
Set up a kickstart meeting with all the stack holders before starting the work, and make sure the time table and allocated resource are clear to all.

### Debriefing
We set 4 standard debriefing milestones, after completion of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the allocated time for the project. at those meeting we ensure that the development progress meets the goals.

## The Code review
Typically at least one Senior developer is assign to each project, along with other developers, rule of thumb here is each new piece of code is developed in a separate branch and a pull request is created at least at the end of the first day.
Once the task is complete the author of the code should review it's own code, make sure all test pass and then assign the PR to one of the senior developers, which will review the code, comment on each line that requires change, and eventually merged into master.

The CTO of the company who is in charge of the overall standardisation, will sit from time to time with each developer on past PRs and make sure the companies standards are maintained.


## Testing suites
**Rules of thumbs:**
* 100% of project have automated test coverage.
* 100% of access related function are tested.
* We aim to have 10%-15% of feature covered by automated testing.

## Issue tracking
* Issues are open in Github with the time estimated in the title using the ... markup.
* The following standard tags are used to mark issues:
# In dev
#  ...
# ...


## Codified knowledge base

## Coding standard

## Prepare your task

## Fix a bug

## Live monitoring
